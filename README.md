Hi there! 👋 I'm Salman MP, a dedicated Web and Graphics Designer with a passion for crafting immersive digital experiences. In my creative world, I've honed my skills as a self-taught designer over the past 7 years, navigating the dynamic landscape of the digital field. Let me take you on a journey through my unique approach to web and graphic design.
🎨 About MeI'm passionate about crafting immersive digital experiences, and my journey began over a decade ago. During my higher secondary studies, I embarked on the web world by creating a WAP site. In those early days, I managed to gather a community with hundreds of users, marking the beginning of my exploration into the vast realm of the internet.
Today, I thrive in the realms of web and media design, where I blend creativity with technology. My heart beats for Next.js, which I use to build full-stack web applications with seamless functionality, alongside my core skills in PHP, HTML, and CSS. I find Laravel to be an interesting framework I'm exploring, and WordPress holds a special place in my journey as it's where my passion meets experience in content management.
